# Vagrant Tutorial

This repository contains the slides of my Vagrant Tutorial, given at [LOADays](http://loadays.org/), 6 April 2014.

## Generating the slide deck

This presentation was created with [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) by converting [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) source into a [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/) slide deck.

To view the presentation, execute `make` in this directory and open `index.html` in a web browser. This wil download reveal.js and install it in the current directory.

## Source code

The presentation contains several hands-on examples. The source code of these can be found at <http://github.com/bertvv/vagrant-example/>.
